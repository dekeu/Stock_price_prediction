# Stock Price Prediction using Hidden Markov Models

## Overview
This project explores **stock price prediction** using Python and the **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** approach.  
By modeling hidden market states (e.g., bullish, bearish, neutral), the system aims to forecast future price movements based on historical data patterns.

## Features
- Preprocessing and visualization of historical stock price data  
- Implementation of HMMs with `hmmlearn`  
- Identification of hidden market regimes  
- Prediction of stock price trends  
- Modular, extensible codebase for experimentation  

## Tech Stack
- Python 
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `hmmlearn`, `scikit-learn` , `seaborn`
